# Race Day 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️

This is a simple JavaScript project that simulates a race day registration system. It assigns race times and race numbers based on the runner's age and whether they registered early.

## 🔧 How It Works
- A random race number between 0 and 999 is assigned
- If the runner is over 18 **and** registered early, they get an earlier race time and a race number above 1000
- Runners over 18 who **didn't** register early get a later time
- Runners under 18 are given a separate time
- All results are displayed in the console
